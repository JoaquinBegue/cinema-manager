GENERAL:
    - if updating, get object data.
    - display corresponding fields with object data.
    - if updating, display object id.


SHOWTIME FORM:
    Datetime availability checking:
        the user will select a movie, an auditorium and a date and then will 
        request the available times for the showtime to start.
        this approach will reduce the logic in frontend and help to code the
        validation in backend.
    
        Frontend:
            An array of intervals of available times will be fetched from the backend.
            This array will be updated any time the user selects a movie, an auditorium
            or a date.
            A loading indicator should be displayed while the array is being fetched.
            The filter function should check if the selected time is in any of the
            intervals of the array.
            
        Backend:
            A view will return the available times for the showtime to start
            based on the selected movie duration, auditorium and date.
