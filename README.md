# cinema-manager
A practice project that emulates a cinema website, where users can browse or search movies and make reservations.
An admin site allows the management of movies, showtimes, reservations and users.
Some of the key functionalities of this project are:
- Seat reservation handling to avoid overbooking.
- Showtime scheduling to avoid overlapping.
- Automated checking of showtime status.

## Current implementation status
At the moment, the project is focused on the user experience of making a reservation for a movie and the management of the cinema system with the admin site.

## Future implementations:
- Emails system.
- Tests.
- Payment system.
- Docker.
- PostgresSQL.
